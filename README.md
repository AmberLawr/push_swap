# push_swap
This project aims to sort through numbers from the smallest to the biggest.

I got nine points out of ten with this sorting approach.

When you read my code, always scroll down to the last function
as that usually contains the most important function.

I have written a short wiki that can be found here: https://github.com/AmberLawr/push_swap/wiki
